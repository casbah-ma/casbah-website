    - 'Creating the endogenous and exogenous conditions for a successful digital transformation. While a top-down approach often covers all the necessary aspects, it may lack the necessary understanding of the operational challenges faced. Interestingly, the most effective ideas for transformation often arise internally. The digital layer serves as an enabling factor to move from ideas to actionable blueprints.'

    - 'Knowing your competitors (direct or indirect) is not necessarily enough to... well, know your competitors. It begins by committing to a method of identifying them objectively and continuously.

    - 'Tech audit:Not all users are at the same stage in their interaction with your brand. Treating them with a one-size-fits-all approach is a missed opportunity, especially when in this digital age, the personal needs of target users can be answered in particular and precise ways. Defining your funnels (whether you’re selling a product or an idea) should be at top of the priorities in order to get through the existing noise.'

  article:
    - "A digital bill is always paid, often through inaction. Between managing the complexity of the tech stack, the hosting and computation, the security risks, compliance with data protection regulations, and the imperative of ongoing maintenance, organizations have to keep an analytical eye on their costs, risks, and threats. One option is to choose the 'free' route by having a limited stack. Then again, think of the person-hours lost, missed opportunities for growth, and other potential shortfalls."

Defining or updating your understanding of who you are, why you exist, and how you engage with the world will empower you to have greater control over your positioning and perception among your audience.'
