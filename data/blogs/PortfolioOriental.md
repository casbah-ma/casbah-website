# ORIENTAL - Regional Council of Tourism - 2021

The Regional Council of Tourism of Oriental (CRT-O) is a devoted association focused on showcasing the tourist destination to both local and international visitors. To achieve this goal, the CRT-O develops a diverse range of promotional materials designed to ease tourists' exploration of the destination and enhance their experience of the available tourism offerings.

This strategy was developed in response to a clear need: to streamline digital priorities and identify means to significantly advance the Oriental region in Morocco. To achieve this, the strategy capitalized on the destination's strengths and weaknesses, yielding a set of strategic directions that shall inaugurate a new era in the digital presence of the Oriental tourism region.

We began by conducting an in-depth analysis through a strategic benchmark, examining successful digital strategies implemented in various tourist destinations. This allowed us to extract valuable insights, identifying both the best practices to emulate and the challenges to address within our context at CRT-O.

Building upon this foundation, we crafted a comprehensive blueprint for the new strategic identity of CRT-O. This involved redefining its core elements such as role, mission, vision, personality, and the specific audience it aimed to engage with and serve.

Furthering our strategy, we meticulously defined our approach to service delivery, tailoring it to meet the distinct needs of both the business-to-business (B2B) sector and the business-to-customer (B2C) segment.

Additionally, we explored global best practices through a detailed operational benchmark across two key areas. Initially, we examined the user journey, considering stages like Captivate, Activate, Generate, Travel, and Advocate. Following that, we delved into different strategies, such as promoting the area, focusing on local promotion, engaging with the local community in a targeted manner, implementing ambassador programs, and incorporating influencer marketing into our approach.

In summary, our collaboration with the Regional Council of Tourism of the Oriental has resulted in a well-crafted digital strategy and a refined organizational identity. These efforts are poised to usher in a new era for the Oriental tourism region, emphasizing a comprehensive approach to digital presence and promotional practices.
